# Caesar Cipher Suite

My version of a simple and flexible command line-based Python implementation of the Caesar cipher.

## Overview

My project implements a basic Caesar transposition cipher with encryption and decryption capabilties that runs in the terminal. It is designed to be easy to use and offers flexibility through custom shift keys. 

## Features

- **Command Line Interface:**  
  Runs tool directly from your cli & is easily accessible.

- **Custom Shift Keys:**  
  Input your own shift key to customize the encryption/decryption process. This adds flexibility and makes the cipher adaptable to your     needs.

- **Input Sanitisation & Validation:**  
  Built-in input validation ensures that users receive helpful error messages in case of mistakes & allows special characters [$, #, .... etc] to function with the cipher as well.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher-cli.git
